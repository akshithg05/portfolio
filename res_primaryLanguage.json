    "description": "I'm Akshith Gunasheelan, a Software Engineer who enjoys building fast, reliable and thoughtfully designed user interfaces. I work across modern web technologies, cloud-driven platforms and ML-supported features, and I focus on turning complex requirements into clean, intuitive and performant experiences. My work in UI engineering and platform development has shaped how I approach software: it should be scalable, user-focused and genuinely meaningful to the people who use it. When I’m not deep in code, I love being outdoors, travelling, exploring new places, running marathons and playing sports. Staying active and trying new experiences keeps me balanced and helps me bring fresh energy and perspective into my work.",
